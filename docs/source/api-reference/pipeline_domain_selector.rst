Overview
--------

The ``pipeline_domain_selector`` module provides a sophisticated system for reproducing the exact physical domain (coordinate system) that a registration pipeline used, including historical and buggy variants. This ensures that voxel indices from ZARR files are mapped to the correct anatomical coordinates before applying transforms.
